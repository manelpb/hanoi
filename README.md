# C# Console Application - Hanoi Tower

In  this  assignment  I  implemented  the  Tower  of  Hanoi  game.  

This is  a mathematical game or puzzle. It consists of three pegs, and a number of disks of different sizes which can slide onto any peg. The puzzle starts with the disks  in  a  neat  stack  in  ascending  order  of  size  on the  left  peg,  the smallest disc at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The  objective  of  the  puzzle  is  to  move all  the  discsto the  right  peg, obeying the following simple rules:

1.Only one disk can be moved at a time.
2.Each move consists of taking the upper discfrom one of the stacks and placing it on top of another stack i.e. a disk can only be moved if it is the uppermost discon a stack.
3.No disc may be placed on top of a smaller disc.
